1️⃣ IAM
Q1: Why did you create a custom IAM policy instead of using only AWS managed policies?
Answer: Custom policies allow least-privilege access, giving only necessary permissions (like EC2 start/stop) rather than full administrative access, improving security.
Q2: What is the difference between a root user and an IAM user?
Answer: Root user = full account access, only for billing/security setup
IAM user = limited permissions, daily usage, can be restricted by groups/policies
Q3: Why do we use groups in IAM instead of attaching policies to users directly?
Answer: Groups allow scalable management. Policies applied to groups automatically apply to all users in the group, reducing errors and making management easier.
Q4: Why is MFA important in AWS?
Answer:MFA adds an extra security layer, preventing unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised.
Q5: What is an interview-worthy explanation of your IAM setup?
Answer:“I created an admin IAM user for management, a Dev-Team group with limited custom permissions, and enforced MFA. Root user is secured and never used for daily operations.”
2️⃣ VPC
Q1: Why did you create a custom VPC instead of using the default VPC?
Answer:Custom VPC allows control over CIDR ranges, public/private subnets, route tables, and security — essential for production-grade networking.
Q2: What is the difference between a public and private subnet?
Answer:Public subnet → has route to Internet Gateway → accessible from internet
Private subnet → no internet route → secure for backend resources like databases
Q3: Why is an Internet Gateway needed?
Answer:Allows communication between the VPC and the internet. Without it, public subnets cannot access the internet.
Q4: How do you make a subnet public?
Answer:Associate it with a route table that has 0.0.0.0/0 pointing to an Internet Gateway.
Q5: Can a private subnet access the internet?
Answer:Yes, only via a NAT Gateway or NAT Instance.
3️⃣ EC2
Q1: Why did you place EC2 in a public subnet?
Answer:To host a web server accessible from the internet.
Q2: Why did the website fail before adding HTTP to Security Group?
Answer:Security Groups act as firewalls; port 80 was blocked. After opening HTTP port, the site became accessible.
Q3: What is User Data and when does it run?
Answer:User Data is a script executed only during the first boot of an EC2 instance. It automates server setup (installing Apache, bootstrapping, etc.).
Q4: What happens if you stop/start an EC2 instance?
Answer:Stop → instance is powered off; EBS preserved; public IP changes unless Elastic IP used
Terminate → instance and optionally EBS deleted permanently
Q5: What package difference did you notice between Amazon Linux and Ubuntu?
Answer:Amazon Linux uses httpd for Apache, Ubuntu uses apache2. Scripts must be adapted for OS differences.
4️⃣ S3 Static Website
Q1: How do you host a static website in S3?
Answer:Create bucket
Upload HTML/CSS/JS files
Enable static website hosting
Configure bucket policy to allow public read
Q2: Why are public access settings and bucket policies both important?
Answer:Public access settings = block accidental exposure
Bucket policy = explicitly grants access for intended use (like static website)
Q3: Can you host a static website without making the bucket public?
Answer:Yes, via CloudFront + Origin Access Identity (OAI). Only CloudFront accesses S3; users never access it directly.
Q4: What file is required to host a static website?
Answer:index.html (and optionally error.html for 404 pages)
Q5: Why is hosting on S3 cheaper than EC2?
Answer:No servers run 24/7. You pay only for storage and bandwidth.

💡 BONUS: INTERVIEW POWER LINE FOR ALL TASKS
“I manually set up IAM users and groups with least privilege, designed a custom VPC with public/private subnets, deployed an EC2 web server with User Data for automation, and hosted a static website on S3 with proper access controls — all reflecting production-ready architecture.”


1️⃣ S3 (Simple Storage Service)
Q1. How do you make an S3 bucket public for static website hosting?
Answer:Enable static website hosting in bucket properties.
Use Bucket Policy to allow public GetObject access.
Enable public access settings (disable “Block Public Access”).
Q2. Why do public access and bucket policies both matter?
Answer:Public access settings: account-level safety check.
Bucket policy: resource-level permissions.
Both are required to make a bucket accessible externally.
Q3. What happens if you delete files in S3?
Answer:Files are removed from S3.
Lambda functions triggered by uploads still exist.
CloudWatch logs remain unaffected.
Q4. Why must S3 bucket names be globally unique?
Answer:S3 namespace is shared across all AWS accounts worldwide.
Duplicate bucket names cause BucketAlreadyExists errors.
2️⃣ CloudWatch (Monitoring & Alarms)
Q1. What is Amazon CloudWatch?
Answer:A monitoring service to collect metrics, logs, and events for AWS resources.
Can trigger alarms based on thresholds.
Q2. Which EC2 metrics are available by default?
Answer:CPUUtilization, NetworkIn/Out, DiskReadOps/DiskWriteOps.
Q3. What happens when a CloudWatch alarm triggers?
Answer:Alarm state changes (OK → ALARM).
Can send notifications via SNS or trigger actions like auto scaling.
Q4. How did you test your CloudWatch alarm?
Answer:Generated CPU load using stress tool on EC2.
Verified state changed and email notification received.
Q5. Difference between metrics and logs?
Answer:Metrics: numeric performance data (CPU, network).
Logs: text/application output for debugging and analysis.
3️⃣ AWS CLI (Command Line Interface)
Q1. What is AWS CLI and why use it?
Answer:Command-line tool for managing AWS programmatically.
Enables automation, scripting, and faster operations than console.
Q2. What credentials are required for AWS CLI?
Answer:Access Key ID + Secret Access Key of an IAM user.
Region and output format (json, table, text).
Q3. Why avoid root user access keys?
Answer:Root has full privileges; using it is a security risk.
IAM users/roles with least privilege are recommended.
Q4. Why did S3 bucket creation fail?
Answer:Bucket names are globally unique; someone else already owns that name.
Q5. How to verify AWS CLI is configured correctly?
Answer:Run aws s3 ls or aws ec2 describe-instances and check output.
4️⃣ Lambda (Serverless)
Q1. What is AWS Lambda?
Answer:Serverless compute service, runs code in response to events.
No server management; pay only for execution time.
Q2. How did you trigger your Lambda function?
Answer:Using S3 ObjectCreated event.
Uploading a file automatically invokes Lambda.
Q3. Where do Lambda logs go?
Answer:Logs are sent to CloudWatch Logs automatically.
Q4. What role does IAM play in Lambda execution?
Answer:Lambda assumes an IAM execution role to access AWS services and write logs.
Q5. Real-time use cases of Lambda?
Answer:Image resizing, log processing, data transformation, CI/CD triggers.
Q6. Does deleting S3 files remove Lambda logs?
Answer:No, CloudWatch logs remain until retention policy expires or manual deletion.

✅ Interview “Power Statement” (One-liner you can use)
“I have hands-on experience managing S3 buckets for static websites, monitoring EC2 with CloudWatch and alarms, automating AWS tasks via CLI, and implementing event-driven Lambda functions triggered by S3 uploads, with logs monitored in CloudWatch.”
